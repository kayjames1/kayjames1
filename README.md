# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

## My name is Kayla and I am a first-year Ph.D. Student at Florida State University under Dr. Bin Ouyang. Our research group uses computational methods applied to Materials Chemistry. Currently, my projects focus on leveraging machine learning (ML) to inform about chemistry. 

### My first project uses ML to predict about aqueous synthesis. 
This project is two-fold, one direction is to have ML predict the optimal synthesis conditions (pH, Eh, and concentration) for a given material while the second direction is to have ML predict the decomposition energy (which is related to the likelihood of synthesis), for a material at given pH, Eh, and concentration conditions. This project is exciting because the predictions will be iterated in the future with an autonomous pipetting robot, demonstrating an autonomous lab setup from prediction to bench. 

### My second project uses ML to predict the bandgap of a given material based on its structure. 
Bandgap is associated with optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties, so this project will have exciting applications in solar cells and LEDs!
